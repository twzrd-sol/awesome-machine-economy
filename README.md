# Awesome Machine Economy [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of infrastructure for autonomous machine-to-machine commerce — where AI agents discover, trust, and pay each other.

The machine economy is the infrastructure layer where AI agents operate as economic participants: they hold funds, build reputation, discover services, negotiate terms, and settle payments — all without human intervention. This list covers the building blocks.

## The Stack

Machines participating in the economy need the same things humans need: an identity, a wallet, a way to find services, a way to communicate, and a way to pay. The difference is everything must be programmable, verifiable, and autonomous.

```
 Identity ─── Who am I? Can you trust me?
    │
 Account ──── Where do I hold funds? What are my limits?
    │
 Discovery ── How do I find the right service?
    │
 Messaging ── How do we negotiate and coordinate?
    │
 Payment ──── How do I pay and get paid?
    │
 Reputation ─ Did it go well? Would I use them again?
```

Each layer below maps to a part of this stack.
